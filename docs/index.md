JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be
fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests.

JSON:API is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of
data transmitted between clients and servers. This efficiency is achieved
without compromising readability, flexibility, or discoverability.

JSON:API requires use of the JSON:API media type
([`application/vnd.api+json`](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.api+json))
for exchanging data.
